## Challenges / Obstacles

What challenges did this data choice present in data gathering, processing and analysis, and how did you work through them? What methods and tools did you use to work with this data?

Working with this API, I had to familiarize myself with how the data was set up and excatly what I wanted to look at. This look a lot of googling, looking at others work, and using some Large Language models as a launching point to get started with the data. To work with this data I used prefect to ingest it and duckdb to store and perform transformations on it. Python was used for visualizations, specifically matplotlib and seaborn.
