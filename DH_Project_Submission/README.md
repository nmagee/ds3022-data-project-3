## Data Source

What data source did you work with?

The data source that we worked with for data project 3 was from the NYT Archive API. This API returns metadata for entire months of New York Times articles at a time, dating all the way back to 1851. We found that there are around 3,000 to 4,000 articles returned for every month, meaning there are around 36,000 to 48,000 articles (or rows of data) published every year. Thus we decided that 3 years of data (or 36 months) would be a sufficient amount of data to gather and work with for this project.
